The [DocGraph](www.docgraph.org) was first presented at the [Stata](http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/11/docgraph-open-social-doctor-data.html) conference in 2012.  This initative crossed a big milestone wherein it applied social network analysis on a network that is not managed formally within a propritory system (like Facebook and LinkedIn).  FOIA enabled Open datasets were used to decipher relationships between healthcare provider entities. As far as we have researched, the data nor the visualization of the graph is publically available yet.  \n\nIn our work, we hope to recreate the graph but with additional considerations that will help answer the followin questions:\n\n1. Who are the most influential doctors for a particular disease area in a specific geography?  \n2. Can we apply ranking or an influence score to the healthcare provider?\n3. Is there a way, using these data, to develop a 'Key Opinion Leader' KOL recommendation engine for payers, pharmaceutical companies, patients, researchers and academia?\n\nThe following datasets and sources were identified for this analysis:\n\n1. [National Plan and Provider Enumeration System](http://nppes.viva-it.com/NPI_Files.html) data from [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Medicare_and_Medicaid_Services) (CMS). This data set captures every provider, plan, and clearinghouse involved in enabling healthcare in the United States.  The [Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) of 1998](http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/HIPAA-Administrative-Simplification/HIPAAGenInfo/index.html) requires every  entity that sends a claim (raises a bill) for providing healthcare to acquire a NPI.  This number is unique as a social security number an dis referenced across public and private systems.  The NPPES data is keyed on [National Provider Identifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Provider_Identifier) (NPI).  The NPEES data is a CSV file that is in exess of 2 GB when uncompressed. It contains one record per covered entity, which include nurse pratitioners, community health centers, hospitals, and other care providers who are not pysicians.  NPI information is also available through API calls via [BloomAPI](http://www.bloomapi.com/documentation) and [DocNPI](http://docnpi.com/).  BloomAPI is opensource, more up-to-date (4-6months after CMS releases the data) but lacks the aility to look up doctors by type (e.g. geography or specialization). This data is available for 2001, 2010 and 2011. [The National Provider Identifier (NPI): What You Need to Know](http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/downloads/NPIBooklet.pdf) booklet is a good resource to understand the NPI categories.  In the grpah database paralance, this is a node database\n\n2. [DocGraph Edge Database v1.0 Open Source](http://notonlydev.com/product/docgraph-edge-database-v1-0-open-source/).  Download for a token of $1.  This is a cleaned up version of the NPPES data.  This data is available for 2011 only.  As the name suggests, this is a edge database\n\n3. [Physician Referral Patterns \u2013 2009, 2010, 2011](http://downloads.cms.gov/foia/Physician-Referrals-2011.txt) : These files represent 3 years of data showing the number of referrals from one physician to another.  This dataset was made available as a FOIA request but seems to have been redacted recently.  The source location is still up but points to a dead link.  We have mentioned it here for reference as the data may not be available due to a technical issue.  The DocGraph dataset should have this data for 2011.  If there is time and the link starts workign, we will expand the graph to inlcude all three years of data.  \n\n4. [Medicare Part D Prescribing Data 2011 & Medicare Part D Prescribing Data (Patients 65 or Older) 2011](https://projects.propublica.org/data-store/) : These data include all drugs prescribed by doctors 11 or more times that year to Part D patients, including those 65 and older. A lookup file is provided to match unique prescriber ID to a practitioner's DEA or NPI number or other identifier.  The NPI number will be used to tie this to the other datasets.  This data is available for 2011 only.  \n\nIdeally we would have liked to use the [American Medical Association Physician Masterfile](http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/physician-data-resources/physician-masterfile.page).  This file has nationa level data on each physician, including demographic, education/training and practice information.  The AMA website describes this file as including \"current and historical data for more than 1.4 million physicians, residents, and medical students in the United States. This figure includes approximately 411,000 graduates of foreign medical schools who reside in the United States and who have met the educational and credentialing requirements necessary for recognition\".  This is not a open dataset and not an option in absence of a budget.  Our choice was limted to the NPPES data or its derivations.  Although all practitioners and healthcare providers that participate in Medicare, Medicaid should have an NPI, the depth and completness of data for physicians is not at par with the AMA master file. \n\nNote: This exercise is based on Medicare data and therfore may not provide a complete picture.  \n\nFor analysis we referenced the work done by [Anthony Damico on public datasets](http://www.asdfree.com/search/label/national%20plan%20and%20provider%20enumeration%20system%20%28nppes%29) specially in terms of using R code.  \n\n\n\n\n\n"
